### Open source projects to which Lev Bernstein has contributed

* [Beardless Bot](https://github.com/LevBernstein/BeardlessBot), a Discord bot
supporting faux gambling (coin flips and blackjack), a currency system, fun
facts, and more. I also wrote a testing framework that allows for 90% code
coverage.

* [TV Tracker](https://github.com/software-assignments-spring2021/project-setup-team-hatsukaichi-dynamic),
an easy, intuitive way to keep track of the shows and movies you're watching
across platforms. Built on the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React,
Node.js).Created as part of Amos Bloomberg's Agile Web Development and DevOps
course.

* [Steam: How Far to the Top?]({{ site.baseurl }}/post4),
a social network analysis tool that measures the degrees of separation between
a user and the top of the steam levels leaderboard.

* [Oppia](https://github.com/oppia/oppia), an open source online learning
platform. I wrote some of the unit tests for six classes in the backend.

* [Nextcord](https://github.com/nextcord/nextcord), a Python API for writing
Discord bots. I contributed 4 PRs that added Python 3.13 compatibility.

* [Anubis](https://github.com/AnubisLMS/Anubis), a distributed Learning
Management System in use in various NYU CS courses. Anubis provides
autograding, cloud IDEs, and more. My contributions to it have been extremely
minor.

* [MooseAPI](https://github.com/LevBernstein/MooseAPI), a simple API that
serves pictures of Moose, a very good dog (may he rest in peace). Written
in Python 3 with FastAPI.

* [Simple Conway]({{ site.baseurl }}/conway), a basic Python
implementation of John Conway's Game of Life. Runs in the browser using [PyScript](https://pyscript.net/).

...and a bunch of others. You can see more
