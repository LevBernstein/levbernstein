### Who is Lev Bernstein?

Truly, I wish I knew. I've heard rumors for many years of a semi-mythical
figure inhabiting the most remote regions of New York City. They say he feeds
on unaware tourists, particularly those who have made the mistake of visiting
Times Square. I've heard that, in his spare time, he listens to a lot of very
[weird music](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2JSGLsBJ6kVbGY1B7LP4Zi?si=2754033a94464650),
that he speaks some Russian, and that he worked for Broadridge as a DevOps Automation Engineer.
Those are all rumors, though, of course.
