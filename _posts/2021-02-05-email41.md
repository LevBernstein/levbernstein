title: "Email: Bionicle Bands"
---

Did you know LEGO™ is responsible for several bands? The Danish band Cryoshell started off making songs for the LEGO™ Bionicle™ movies, including the fourth Bionicle™ movie, BIONICLE™: The Legend Reborn. The trailer and credits for The Legend Reborn featured Cryoshell’s Bye Bye Babylon, one of the better songs to be included in Bionicle™ movie end credits. Perhaps the best part is that the music video for Bye Bye Babylon contains the actual band, rather than the Bionicles™ the song was made for. Presumably, this sparked so much indignation that it prompted a fan to make their own music video containing both the band and scenes from the trailer featuring Mata Nui, the star of The Legend Reborn. [Here it is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Abz73P1KQkI). If for some reason you feel like reading about the expansive plot of the Bionicle™ universe, 1. you’re a fool, and 2. sadly, the Wikipedia page had the plot section almost entirely removed in early March 2020. Lucky for us, [the internet archive preserved it](https://web.archive.org/web/20191201234600/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bionicle). Fun tangent: I know for a fact that one of the writers for Bionicle™ contributed to the Bionicle™ Wikipedia page. I know this because they left a comment in the talk section saying they should get more credit for their work. I love Wikipedia.

See you all at practice,
