title: "Email: Medieval Bloodsports"

Today's email is about medieval bloodsports (except for bull-baiting, which gets its own email). Let's take a quick trip down memory lane to look at some of the best bloodsports Europe had to offer. There's that crowd favorite, [fox tossing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_tossing), in which foxes and other small animals were thrown onto a piece of fabric, which was then stretched taut, launching them high into the air. The sport was enjoyed by Kings and Emperors, as well as every other bored, blood-crazed lunatic.

How could I not mention [cock throwing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cock_throwing), an English bloodsport that involved throwing sticks at birds until they died. That's the whole game. Still, that made more sense than [goose pulling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goose_pulling), which featured a lubed-up goose tied to a rope. Competitors on horseback would ride by and try to rip off the goose's head at speed. Then there's goose pulling's close relative, eel pulling. [Here's a fun video on a riot it caused](https://youtu.be/MAGCTXz13js?t=450).

There are some animal fighting sports still practiced today, like [camel wrestling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sb7XTSn-vE), [bullfighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullfighting), [cricket fighting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST954vgfvhQ), and, of course, the particularly cruel [cockfighting](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/operation-angry-birds-busts-ny-cockfighting-ring/). Nowadays, however, most people prefer animals to have safer, auxiliary roles in sports, which gives us sports like skijoring. Skijoring is a sport that developed out of Sámi reindeer herding and racing. The skier holds onto a rope or harness attached to a reindeer, dog, motorcycle, snowmobile, or, in the U.S., a horse. They try to hang on as they go over jumps, dodge obstacles, and collect rings. American skijoring is a curious blend of this very Nordic activity with American cowboy culture. [Here’s a video about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kht7_NgJXnw).

I'll see you all at practice,
