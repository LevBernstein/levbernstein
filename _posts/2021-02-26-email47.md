Here's some random stuff, because I'm low on time! Did you know that Gerard de Nerval [had a pet lobster he walked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%A9rard_de_Nerval#Travels), using a silk ribbon on a leash? Did you know that if you earn less than $69,000 per year, [you can file your taxes online, for free](https://www.irs.gov/filing/free-file-do-your-federal-taxes-for-free), using a lot of well-known tax filing websites and applications? Did you also know that tax filing websites, like TurboTax, [have deliberately altered their Google search results to hide that fact from you](https://www.propublica.org/article/turbotax-deliberately-hides-its-free-file-page-from-search-engines)? Did you know that [flea circuses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flea_circus) are a real thing?

If you knew any of that, congratulations! You should probably come to Quiz Bowl practice. I'll see you all there.

Best,
