title: "Email: Slapfight"

This week's secret code word is Brazil. Anyway, here is some bloodsport for your amusement (the first of many emails about various bloodsports). First, some background info: what you're about to see is a Russian show run by a bunch of Russian youtubers called Каменные Лица, or Stone Faces, in which the competitors just slap the hell out of each other. It’s based on a sport found at the Siberian Power Show that looks very similar; [here’s an article about it](https://www.ktvq.com/news/trending/russian-strongmen-compete-to-win-slap-championships). The champion, Василий Камоцкий, is nicknamed Пельмень, or Dumpling. In his normal life he’s a farmer from Krasnoyarsk. He’s used his winnings from slap fighting to fulfill his dream of buying a combine harvester. His opponent here is Zuluzinho, a Brazilian Vale Tudo fighter whom the Russians refer to as Чёрный Папа, or “Black Papa.” I recommend turning subtitles on. [Here’s the title bout](https://youtu.be/G5DhR1G6BJI?t=995).

I'll see you all at practice, so long as you tell me the secret code word. If you don't, the Score Bot will vaporize you. Best,
