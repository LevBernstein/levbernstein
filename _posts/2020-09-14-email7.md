title: "Email: London Calling"
---

Sadly, I fear my time with you will be short; I received what I think was a warning, and now I fear for my life. I was making my morning sacrifice to Marduk when I noticed something odd in the entrails of my augury pig. “I don’t think the Clash’s London Calling is a punk album,” the viscera spelled out in perfect clarity. Confused, I retreated to my study to ponder this mysterious turn of events and look up this “London Calling,” but my arcane library and all its contents had vanished. I suspect there to be a malevolent presence manipulating events from behind the scene. Beware! Beware! If you have any idea what my pig’s entrails were trying to tell me, please tell me at practice.

Best,
