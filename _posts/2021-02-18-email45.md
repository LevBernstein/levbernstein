Believe it or not, sometimes libertarians have bad ideas. Shocking, right? One of those bad ideas was the [Free State Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_State_Project). The plan was, tens of thousands of libertarians would move to New Hampshire together and effectively take over the state's politics. They started small, aiming to transform the town of Grafton. As plans go, it was certainly one of them. Unfortunately for them, and perhaps fortunately for the State of New Hampshire, they were foiled by a rogue bear. [Actually, make that several bears](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/21534416/free-state-project-new-hampshire-libertarians-matthew-hongoltz-hetling).

See you all at practice,
