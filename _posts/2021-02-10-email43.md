Seeing things is overrated, I think, given how many things suck to look at. Some people choose not to see things for a short period of time as a challenge. Here are three videos of people doing so, but for video games, because of course that’s what I’m talking about. First, [the first ever 100% FC of Through the Fire and Flames played blindfolded](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=99&v=cyKdFb1ZWUU&feature=youtu.be); [the history of blindfolded Mike Tyson's Punch-Out for the NES](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZT6JEOC3D8); and finally, [completing Super Mario 64 blindfolded in 40 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=146&v=ZcOd82Q6-oU&feature=youtu.be).

See you all at practice,
