If you're reading this, I managed to fork this site from my Open Source
Software Development class. I've wanted to had a personal website for some
time, but have never really had the time to set one up myself. Now, I do.

I'm not sure what I'm really going to use this for; I can't imagine I'll be
posting a lot, but if I ever have stuff to say, I can put it here. Hooray.
