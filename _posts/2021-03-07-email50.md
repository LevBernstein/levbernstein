title: "Email: Rap Opera"
---

Got a weird saga for you today. Please [CONSUME THIS SONG MEDIA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6rwk7_Gl4), preferably without reading the YouTube comments. Interesting song, right? The original is by a Romanian group, the Blaxy Girls. This remixed version of that song opens with a sample of Beijing opera; specifically, [this piece](https://youtu.be/EmHYhDXz-Zs). The speed at which it is recited, however, has led many to call it Chinese rap; for [whatever reason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism), it is then often associated with [the album cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lGFpyuuchg) of MC Jin's "The Rest Is History." YouTube's recommendation algorithm often pairs that with [this entirely unrelated song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CawoPNkY00). I'd again recommend avoiding reading the comments, again [for no real reason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism). What was the point of all this? What did we learn? Nothing. Less than nothing. Just the way I like it.

See you all at practice,
