title: "Email: Reindeer Milk"
---

I opened up my fridge the other day, and, to my surprise, all my food was gone. Instead, I was confronted by the sight of a hundred bottles of reindeer milk. I didn’t even know you could milk a reindeer. This reminds me of that time they found 300 reindeer dead in a field in Norway with no visible injuries. It turns out that the reindeer had been huddled together when a bolt of lightning struck the wet ground and killed them all. [Here’s a national geographic article about it](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2016/08/norway-reindeer-lightning-weather/) (warning: contains photos of hundreds of dead reindeer).

I’ll be attending a reindeer funeral from 4 PM to 6 PM, but after that’s done I’ll see you all at practice.

Best,

Lev "Reindeer Milk" Bernstein
