title: "Email: The Cleveland Browns and Matisyahu"
---

Hope you're all finding fun things to do over break. Me, I spent the day watching all of Man Like Mobeen and eating leftovers. I'm really thriving, living my best life. Oh, speaking of thriving, the Cleveland Browns made history by winning a playoff game! It's the first time they've ever done so (since the expansion etc etc). [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gZndxEvFNk) will have to be updated, I suppose.

Matisyahu is a Jewish reggae artist. Almost every Jew who went to Hebrew School in the past decade has heard of Matisyahu. [We all had to listen to this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRmBChQjZPs) while watching the "cool" Hebrew teacher nod in satisfaction. Matisyahu eventually stepped away from Orthodox Judaism, shocking Hasidim everywhere by shaving his beard and bleaching his hair. [Hereâ€™s a whiny article about it](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/matisyahu-transformation-religious-jews-react_b_1571249?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9lbi53aWtpcGVkaWEub3JnL3dpa2kvTWF0aXN5YWh1&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAMWpwW31o1HmzEptcPWHLh2htGXT5GnZzRrSP6zC-WYpNiYKksLyKptddioikG6yq-UEiA-hQ0a9qos0c_9UNIJdJDviVO74vUsc90q7iOI2JFsTsxrlEtL3rX-FBdxvp3nEpE_nUNxKG67kuHnVMoA7IKWkSDdQ0sWppuYXaq9U) that also serves to illustrate some of the problems inherent to a parasocial relationship, especially ideas of obligation.

See you all at practice,
