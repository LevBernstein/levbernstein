I’ve never met anyone named Bob from my generation. Met a few Roberts, but no Bobs. Bob was once an incredibly popular name, but it has really died out in recent years. In some ways, that’s kind of a tragedy. [Here’s part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvh6NLqKRfs) of an excellent 2-part video by Jon Bois about why we should lament the death of Bob, focusing on the contributions of the Bobs to sports. I’m not much of a sports fan, but Jon Bois has a way of making sports interesting even to non-fans like me.

See you all at practice,
