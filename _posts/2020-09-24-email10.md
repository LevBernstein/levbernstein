title: "Email: Video Game Montages"
---

Apologies for the late email; it's been a difficult day. As per your vote in the discord, this week's fun thing is some word-salad about video game montages I wrote this summer for no reason. It was too long for this email, so I made a Medium account and [posted it here. That's how much I care](https://medium.com/@lev2000/video-game-frag-movies-fdf58c46fa4?sk=7edfdc6a5e799f65bd46edf1544c4241).

I'll see you all at practice.

Best,
