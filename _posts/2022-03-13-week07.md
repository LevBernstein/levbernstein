title: "Week 7, the Cathedral and the Bizarre"

[Good essay](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/index.html). Well, mostly.

I really only had one major critique. At one point, Raymond brings up a
Kropotkin quote, and then immediately seeks to use it to make a point about
harnessing the power of egoism (or what he calls egoism, but is really just
ego). Aside from the fact that Kropotkin wouldn't have been caught dead among
egoists, this feels intellectually dishonest.

That's not to say that my one critique is the only one there is. Aside from
Raymond's other ideas (including his *extremely homophobic* essay "The Elephant
in the Bath-House" and his *extremely racist* essay "Dilemmatizing the NRA")
and the fact that the new maintainers of Fetchmail
[broke with](https://www.fetchmail.info/design-notes.html) many of the design
decisions Raymond set, there are some flaws in the essay itself.

In the interest of brevity, I'll mention three main critiques posed by Nikolai
Bezroukov in "[A Second Look at the Cathedral and the Bazaar](https://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/708/618)."

1. The Open Source bazaar model is not actually revolutionary or new; rather,
it's simply another instance of a scientific community governing by consensus.

2. Given how much Linux owes GNU, one can view Linux as simply another piece
or continuation of the larger GNU project.

3. Linux's connection to the University of Helsinki was extremely important in
the formative early development of the project, similarly to GNU's connection
with MIT.

I must admit that critique 1 makes the most sense to me. To a great extent, the
bazaar model is really just scientific consensus in action. The community as a
whole discusses an issue, proposes theories, and comes up with answers. If
you look at it through that lens, Open Source becomes less of a revolutionary
new idea than a way to reuse an old, successful one.

That's not to say that Open Source isn't a powerful idea; in fact, tying Open
Source to the Scientific Method can only serve to give it more legitimacy. And
in terms of power and impact, just look at
[the effect OSINT is having](https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/technology/956029/what-is-open-source-intelligence-ukraine-war)
right now in Ukraine.

All of that makes you really appreciate the power of Open Source. To some
extent, it also adds import to considerations of picking a project. I have some
projects in mind, but I'm not sure they're sufficiently bold. Still, any
contribution can be taken as a sacrament, or, less religiously, as bulding off
of others' contributions to science as a whole.
