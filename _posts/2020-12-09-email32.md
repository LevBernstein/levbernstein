LET'S SAY, HYPOTHETICALLY, SOMEONE MURDERS SOMEONE ELSE IN ANTARCTICA'S MCMURDO STATION AT 4:17 PM ON JANUARY 28TH 2021. WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO THAT HYPOTHETICAL MURDERER? IF THAT MURDERER WERE, AGAIN HYPOTHETICALLY, FROM THE U.S., THEY WOULD BE ARRESTED BY A U.S. MARSHAL, AS LAW ENFORCEMENT FROM THE SAME NATION AS THE ACCUSED HYPOTHETICAL MURDERER HAS JURISDICTION OVER THEM. AGAIN, HYPOTHETICALLY. HERE'S [A NON-HYPOTHETICAL INCIDENT OF ATTEMPTED MURDER IN ANTARCTICA](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/xw9bg3/an-attempted-murder-at-a-research-station-shows-how-crimes-are-prosecuted-in-antarctica) AND [HERE'S THE WIKIPEDIA PAGE FOR CRIME IN ANTARCTICA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_in_Antarctica).

SEE YOU ALL AT PRACTICE (ASSUMING I'VE NOT YET BEEN ARRESTED),

LEV BERNSTEIN

SECRETARY, QUIZ BOWL AT MCMURDO STATION, SEPTEMBER 2020-JANUARY 28TH 2021
