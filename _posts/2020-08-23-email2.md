[Here's some history for you: the time the U.S. almost destroyed the Eastern half of North Carolina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1961_Goldsboro_B-52_crash).

If you want to read more, [here's the full list of American nuclear incidents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Nuclear_accidents_and_incidents_in_the_United_States).

On that cheery note, I'll see you all at practice on Friday. Best,
