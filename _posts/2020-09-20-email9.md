title: "Email: Headstrong"

Today's fun random information, as voted on by the discord server: Kidz Bop has done some really weird covers throughout its wretched, tortured existence. One of the strangest is probably a cover of Trapt’s Headstrong. For those not familiar with Trapt, they made that one song and now all they do is get into weird conservative twitter beef. Here’s the Kidz Bop cover, for your displeasure; oddly for a Kidz Bop song, while a chorus of kids shouts the chorus over and over, an adult sings the verses. [Here it is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNdxz1YX22g).

See you at practice,
