Hate crimes against Asian people in the U.S. [have been on the rise](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/02/27/asian-hate-crimes-attacks-fueled-covid-19-racism-threaten-asians/4566376001/) for the past year, and while the cause of this surge is hard to determine, I would guess pervasive racism has something to do with it. Maybe. One particularly annoying racist trope applied to people from all across Asia is the idea that Asian people swap their "l" and "r" sounds. For a good explanation of the intricacies of the English "l" and "r," and the problems with assuming everyone from Asia does this, [here's a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yzMUs3badc).

If you meet one of these racists, odds are they don't really want to hear about the flaws in their beliefs. You'll have to turn to other manners. You could always feed them to [a carnivorous plant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGJ7tg0ifmo). That's what I usually do and it works great!

See you all at practice,
