title: "Email: Shepard Tone"
---

As per my campaign promise, I'll be including something interesting in every email I send you. I have a grand narrative I'd like to play out over the emails, but that won't begin until the year starts in earnest. Anyway, here's today's interesting thing. The Shepard Tone is a kind of illusion in which a sound appears to be increasing or decreasing in pitch constantly, though it is actually looping back to its start. [Here's an example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:DescenteInfinie.ogg). After you listen to that, [here's a video explaining how it works and showing some more examples](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVWTQcZbLgY). Finally, here's a [song I like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVekJTmtwqM) that uses the Shepard Tone. I'd recommend listening to the whole song, but if you don't want to, use of the Shepard Tone in it starts at 7:17.

Best,
