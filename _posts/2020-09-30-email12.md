title: "Email: Rent = 61 Nails"
---

As part of an archaic ceremony, the city of London pays an annual rent of a knife, an axe, six horseshoes, and 61 nails to a representative of the Queen. The city has been doing this for around 800 years, even though I doubt the Queen wants anything to do with six oversized horseshoes. An actual government official, who normally has other stuff to do, has to spend however much time every year doing this meaningless ceremony. If the ceremony gathered spectators or was a real part of the culture, Iâ€™d understand it, but the ceremony generally goes all but unattended. Some poor sap has been handing over exactly 61 nails for 800 years, and will continue doing so until the end of time, all because someone thought it was a cute idea to continue paying rent in knives. [Doesnâ€™t that make you want to just ride a horse into the ocean?](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/london-is-still-paying-rent-to-the-queen-on-a-property-leased-in-1211?utm_source=Atlas+Obscura+Daily+Newsletter&utm_campaign=3b6f59702c-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2020_07_20&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_f36db9c480-3b6f59702c-67684577&mc_cid=3b6f59702c&mc_eid=21282c1dca)
